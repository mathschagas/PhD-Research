# JSON Model for Task Structure

This is a JSON file that serves as a template for defining a data structure for a task. JSON is a lightweight, human-readable data format widely used for information exchange between systems.

In this model, we have a main object called "task" that contains several properties. I'll explain each of them:

- **name**: This property represents the name of the task and is a string. You can replace "" with the desired name.

- **description**: This property represents the task description and is also a string. You can replace "" with the desired description.

- **context_descriptors**: This property is an array containing objects representing the task's context descriptors. Each object has the following properties:

  - **name**: The name of the context descriptor.
  
  - **description**: The description of the context descriptor.
  
  - **type**: The data type of the context descriptor, which can be a string, integer, float, or boolean. You can replace "", "", and "string|integer|float|boolean" with the desired values.

- **constraints**: This property is an array containing objects representing the task's constraints. Each object has the following properties:

  - **name**: The name of the constraint.
  
  - **logical_expression**: The logical expression combining the constraint conditions using logical operators like AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, or XNOR.
  
  - **conditions**: An array of objects representing the constraint conditions. Each object has the following properties:
  
    - **condition_id**: The unique identifier of the condition.
    
    - **attribute**: The name of the attribute used in the condition.
    
    - **condition_operator**: The comparison operator used in the condition, such as greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, less than or equal to, equal to, or not equal to.
    
    - **value**: The value used in the condition. It can be a fixed value or the name of an attribute. You can replace "", "", "", and "|" with the desired values.

- **default_cbr**: This property is an array containing objects representing the task's default CBR (Cost, Benefit, and Risk). Each object has the following properties:

  - The property names are the attribute names.
  
  - The property values are the attribute weights.
  
  - "" represents whether the attribute should be maximized or minimized. It can be "max" or "min". You can replace "", "", "", etc., with the desired values.

- **uncertainty_runtime_cbr**: This property is an array containing objects representing the task's runtime CBR with uncertainty. Each object has the following properties:

  - The attribute name represents the name of the uncertainty.
  
  - The attribute value is an object containing the properties "constraints" and "cbr". The properties are similar to those described earlier for "constraints" and "default_cbr".

This JSON model provides a flexible structure for defining tasks with context descriptors, constraints, and CBR. You can fill in the desired values for the properties to create a specific instance of this data structure.
